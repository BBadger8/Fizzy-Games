# Fizzy-Games

**Group Project Proposal**
Group Members: Grace Bartley, Brant Badger, Adam Joseph Laloge

**Group Name:** 
The name of the group will be “Fizzy Games”. It is simple but it is a fitting name for the idea. It is fizz from a soda that can seem refreshing and we hope to do that with the skills we have in making the game.

**Group Preferred Method of Communication:**
We have decided that the best way to communicate for this project is through Discord. We will be meeting together in discord calls and we will share each other’s process in both a discord call and the channels.

**GitHub Repository:**

**The Game We Would Like to Make:**

Adv. Simulation/Game Design Group 5(Name Pending).
(Everyone has to agree upon this first) This will be a top-down angle 2D pixel art roguelike action game where the player explores room to room fighting enemy hordes to complete each room and earn power-ups after completing each room. After 10 rooms at max (we will just have the rooms made for the project) There will be a boss fight that tests your skills and the power-ups that you got from the previous room.

**Game Description**
We are on an adventure through a dungeon with our adequately prepared hero to go through the treacherous dungeon to save his wife after she was taken from their home by an even dark lord from another kingdom. The hero in this game will explore a dungeon, going through floor after floor killing monsters, and earning power-ups to help on his quest to save his wife. You as the player have to travel through each level(room) of the dungeon and gain abilities that raise your attack power, speed, and other skills that will help the hero defeat the enemies that get in his way.
He doesn’t truly know why the dark lord has decided to take his wife but only knows after finding their home in ruin leaving a note saying that he will have to go through a trial to save her. The real reason behind it all is that the wife didn’t know how to tell her dark lord father about her marriage to the human hero, so in the best way she knew, she pretended she was taken by her dark lord father. So now the hero is on a quest to save his wife from the clutches of the Dark Lord.
