# Fizzy-Games

**Group Project Proposal**
Group Members: Grace Bartley, Brant Badger, Adam Joseph Laloge

**Group Name:** 
The name of the group will be “Fizzy Games”. It is simple but it is a fitting name for the idea. It is fizz from a soda that can seem refreshing and we hope to do that with the skills we have in making the game.

**Group Preferred Method of Communication:**
We have decided that the best way to communicate for this project is through Discord. We will be meeting together in discord calls and we will share each other’s process in both a discord call and the channels.

**GitHub Repository:**

**The Game We Would Like to Make:**

Adv. Simulation/Game Design Group 5(Name Pending).
Game description(WIP): (Everyone has to agree upon this first) The game that we planned on making for this project is a top down at an angle roguelike game that will be a story about the player (haven’t decided what they are) going on a mission to defeat the main antagonist of the game (could be some ethereal being).
